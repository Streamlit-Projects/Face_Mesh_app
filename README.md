# DigitalPipe - Face Mesh <br><br/>

MediaPipe Face Mesh is a computer vision technology developed by Google's MediaPipe team. It is a machine learning model that can accurately detect and track facial landmarks in real-time.

Facial landmarks refer to specific points on the face, such as the corners of the eyes, the tip of the nose, and the edges of the mouth. These landmarks can be used for a variety of applications, including facial recognition, augmented reality, and emotion detection.

MediaPipe Face Mesh uses a deep neural network to predict the 3D positions of 468 facial landmarks. This model can be run on a variety of devices, including smartphones and laptops, making it highly accessible.

The technology has been used in a variety of applications, such as virtual try-on experiences, interactive filters for social media, and real-time facial animation.
